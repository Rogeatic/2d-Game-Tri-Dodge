{I wanted to get better at unity 2d and making 2d games. I have a lot of experience in 3d games but not 2d so I thought it would be cool. It took longer than I thought it would but I got it done.}

{In this game, youâ€™re a triangle that dodges falling cubes and you have a timer on screen that has a score for you to show off.}

{I thought it would be cool to see people playing a little game I made that would be easy to play.}

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the game being played and a walkthrough of the code.}

{I used c# with the unity libraries.}

# Useful Websites
Stack overflow lol
I got the song I used on the YouTube audio library.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* I could make the score stay over time
* cubes could just move towards you from all directions
* I could add jetpack effects
